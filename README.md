# DailyProject

This is a challenge where I try to do a project every day. The reason behind this is, that I want to improve my skills and I really want to bring out the best in me.

## Additional Information

### Rules

* The projects can be everything! It doesn't matter how big or small the project is, on the one day it's maybe just a collection of buttons or some other components. On the other day it's maybe a whole website or an interactive application.
* The projects don't have to be perfect. Doing a project every day is hard enough, so the project don't have to be pixel-perfect, responsive or completely bug free.
* Takin a break for one or more days is only allowed when I'm feeling sick or something important happens in real-life.
